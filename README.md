# Origami-Solar-Panel-Unfolding
This project automates the folding and unfolding of an origami-inspired solar panel using servo motors controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The code models the folding mechanics based on the geometry of a polygonal structure, using the number of sides in the folded polygon to calculate the appropriate unfolding angles.
